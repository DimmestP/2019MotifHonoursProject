# 2019MotifHonoursProject
Code and resources compiled together as part of the Jan 2019 honours student project on predicting the effects of 3'UTR motifs

Please make sure you have installed the R programming language, its exceptionally useful IDE Rstudio and the sanity saving version control software git.

## Getting Started
First off let us make sure git and Rstudio are correctly installed (and than we can talk about what they do!).

Open a terminal and use the cd command to move to a suitable folder for all future honours project work (i.e. a place regularly backed up).

Towards the top right of this page is the download 

```bash
git clone <repository url>
```
